# JavaScript Behind the Scenes

## High-level Overview of JavaScript

- **High-level** language.
- **Garbage collector** - automatically removes old unused objects from the computer memory.
- **Interpreted** or **Just-in-time compiled** language - compiles the code to machine code.
- Multi-paradigm language. Procedural programming, **OOP programming**, **Functional programming**.
- Proto-type-based object-oriented language. Almost everything is an object in JavaScript.
- **First-class functions** - Functions are treated like any other variables. We can pass them to other functions as arguments or return them from other functions.
- **Dynamic typing** - We don't have to declare the type of a variable. Instead, they will be known only when JS engine executes our code.
- **Single-threaded**.
- **Non-blocking** event loop.
